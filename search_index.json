"],["diatonic-chords-in-common-scales.html", "Chapter 1 Diatonic Chords in Common Scales References", " Chapter 1 Diatonic Chords in Common Scales This section lists triads and chords in the Major, and Minor scales. Chords in these scales are constructed using intervals of 3rds. E.g., in the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the C major 7 chord is constructed using C, E, G, B.

For example, playing Am7 over Dm7 adds extensions 9 and 11 to Dm7 (notes E and G). Substitution refers to replacing the original chord by one from a different scale, with the goal of adding tension that will be resolved. For example, playing AbmMaj7 instead of G7 in the progression G7-C can be thought of as altering the G7 with b9 and #5 (notes Ab and Eb). 2.1 Diatonic superimpositions using chord degrees Diatonic superimpositions involve replacing a chord with another chord from the same scale. The replacement chords are built from degrees of the original chord, and are in the same parent scale (e.g. major). This replacement adds extensions to a chord in order of the scale degrees. Example 1: sups over Cmaj7 using the C major scale: Cmaj7 has the notes C, E, G, B. The chord built on the 3rd (E) is Em7 (notes E, G, B, D). Playing Em7 over Cmaj7 adds a 9th to the original Cmaj7. Playing G7 (G B D F) over Cmaj7 adds the extensions 9 and 11, and playing Bm7b5 (B, C, F, A) adds the extensions 9, 11, and 13. Example 2: sups over Fmaj7 in the C major scale: Fmaj7 has the notes F, A, C, E. The chord built on the 3rd (A) is Am7 (notes A, C, E, G). Playing Am7 over Fmaj7 adds a 9th to the original Fmaj7. However, playing Cmaj7 (C E G B) over Fmaj7 adds the notes G (9th) and B (#11), not 9th and 11. This is because the C major scale has a natural B, not a Bb, so using it for building the new chord yields the #11 extension. In the following two tables, “Scale Chord” is the original chord, “Subs built on chord tones” contains the diatonic chords built on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th (or flat 7th) degrees of the original chords, and “Extensions” contains all the extensions added (the sub on 7th degree provides all 3 extensions). The other set of columns provides an example in G. Concretely, for the scale chord ii (Am7 in G major scale), the diatonic chord built on the 5th degree is the vi chord of the parent scale (Em7 in G major), and playing vi over ii yields extensions 9 and 11.

A functioning dominant is a chord that resolves a 4th up (or 5th down), to its I chord. For example, if G7 is followed by a C chord, the G7 is a functioning dominant. To get alterations for G7, play the G Altered Scale (7th mode of Melodic Minor) over G7. 2.3 Tritone substitution 2.4 Adding movement to a chord Secondary dominants and ii chords Barry Harris diminished approach 2.5 References Superposition vs Substitution, with example over F blues "],["resources.html", "Chapter 3 Resources", " Chapter 3 Resources Jazz theory blogs Jazz Advice Youtube channels Jens Larsen Rick Beato JustinGuitar RealBassLessons Books/DVDs Modal Jazz Composition &amp; Harmony (Ron Miller) Chordability (Roni Ben-Hur) Fretboard Logic SE (Bill Edwards) Paid Courses TrueFire Discover Double Bass Software Band In A Box - software for creating backing tracks Transcribe! - player for transcribing audio Guitar Pro - notation software for guitar &amp; other instruments Neck Diagrams - program to create neck diagrams for scales &amp; chords "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
