Disclaimer: Theory vs Sounding Good Music theory is fun and can be used to try to understand why a particular chord progression or melody sounds the way it does, or how to approach soloing over a tune. But theory should not dictate what to play: things can sound great (or bad) despite what the theory says. It also seems that music theory doesn’t always neatly describe everything that’s going on. All this to say that not all of what’s in here is useful, and some of it definitely goes into unnecessary detail.

Chords in these scales are constructed using intervals of 3rds. E.g., in the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the C major 7 chord is constructed using C, E, G, B.

There seem to be many ways of thinking about this, and what follows describes just some of them. Concepts and Terms Soloing and Comping The concepts described here are used both for soloing and comping applications. Chord Superimposition and Chord Substitution Superposition refers to adding extensions to a chord by superimposing another chord from the same scale over the original. For example, playing Am7 over Dm7 adds extensions 9 and 11 to Dm7 (notes E and G). Substitution refers to replacing the original chord by one from a different scale, frequently with the goal of adding tension that will be resolved. For example, playing AbmMaj7 instead of G7 in the progression G7-C can be thought of as altering the G7 with b9 and #5 (notes Ab and Eb). Functioning and Static Dominant Chords A functioning dominant is a dominant chord that resolves a 4th up (or 5th down), to its I chord. For example, if G7 is followed by a C chord, the G7 is a functioning dominant. A static dominant is a dominant chord that does not resolve to its I. For example, if G7 is followed by E7, the G7 is a static dominant. Triads and 7th Chords The concepts in this section are illustrated mostly using 7th chords. However, not every substitution has to use all notes from the new chord - the sub can be a triad, or a 2 note chord. Diatonic Superimpositions Diatonic superimpositions involve replacing a chord with another chord from the same scale. The replacement chords are built from degrees of the original chord, and are in the same parent scale (e.g. Major Scale). This replacement adds extensions to a chord in order of the scale degrees. Superimpositions are an alternative way, or maybe a shorthand, of thinking about chords with extensions. Instead of thinking “Dm13” to create a minor 13 sound over Dm7, one might think “Cmaj7” and play Cmaj7 over Dm7, creating the minor 13 sound. A superposition built on the 3rd of the original chord is also called “3-to-9”, since the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th of the original chord are now being played. Example 1: Superpositions over Cmaj7 in C Major Cmaj7 has the notes C, E, G, B. The chord built on the 3rd (E) is Em7 (notes E, G, B, D). Playing Em7 over Cmaj7 adds a 9th to the original Cmaj7, making it into Cmaj9. Playing G7 (G B D F) over Cmaj7 adds the extensions 9 and 11, and playing Bm7b5 (B, C, F, A) adds the extensions 9, 11, and 13. Example 2: Superpositions over Fmaj7 in C Major Fmaj7 has the notes F, A, C, E. The chord built on the 3rd (A) is Am7 (notes A, C, E, G). Playing Am7 over Fmaj7 adds a 9th to the original Fmaj7. However, playing Cmaj7 (C E G B) over Fmaj7 adds the notes G (9th) and B (#11), not 9th and 11. This is because the C Major Scale has a natural B, not a Bb, so using it for building the new chord yields the #11 extension. In the following two tables, “Orig. Chord” is the original chord, “Subs built on chord tones” contains the diatonic chords built on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th (or flat 7th) degrees of the original chords, and “Extensions” contains all the extensions added (the sub on 7th degree provides all 3 extensions). The other set of columns provides an example in G. Concretely, for the original chord ii (Am7 in G major scale), the diatonic chord built on the 5th degree is the vi chord of the parent scale (Em7 in G major), and playing vi over ii yields extensions 9 and 11.

The result is equivalent to Dm11 - G9 - C9. In C minor: Dm7b5 - G7 - Cm6 -&gt; Fm7 - Bdim - Cm6 Fm7 starts on the 3rd of Dm7b5, Bdim starts on the 3rd of G7. The result is equivalent to Dm9b5 - G9 - Cm6. Melodic Minor for Functioning Dominants Chords from the 7th mode of the Melodic Minor Scale (Altered Scale) can be used to add tension to a functioning dominant 7th chord. The Altered Scale played over the V yields the following chord degrees (relative to the V): R, b9, #9, 3, b5, #5, b7. This scale thus introduces 4 new notes to the G7 chord - b9 and #9 instead of the 9th, and b5 and #5 instead of the 5th. Chords from the Altered Scale contain the alterations in various combinations. The notes of the Altered Scale for a dominant are the same as the notes of the Melodic Minor Scale 1/2 step up from the dominant root. E.g., the G Altered Scale is Ab Melodic Minor. While it is possible to use alterations on a dominant resolving to a minor chord, tension in such dominant chords is created by adding notes from the Harmonic Minor or other scales (e.g. C Harmonic Minor over G7 in the progression G7-Cm). Example: G altered Playing the Ab Melodic Minor (G Altered Scale) over G7 yields the notes G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Bb, Db, Eb, F. This scale contains G, Cb, and F, which are the Root, 3rd, and b7 of G7. It also contains Ab and Bb (b9 and #9) and Db and Eb (b5 and #5). To add alterations to the harmony for G7, play chords from Ab Melodic Minor over the G7. The following table summarizes alterations created by substituting a dominant chord with chords from the related Melodic Minor Scale. “MM Chord” is the chord in Melodic Minor, and “MM Intervals” are the MM intervals in that chord. “V7alt Intervals” are the intervals of the same notes in relation to the dominant chord. “V7alt Chord” is the new chord created by playing the MM chord over the dominant. The last 3 columns contain examples over the G7 chord.

In Bb major: F7 - Bbmaj7 -&gt; D7 - Bbmaj7 F7 contains #9, b5, and #5. Tritone substitution Examples in Progressions A7 - Dm7 - G7 - C -&gt; Eb7 - Dm7 - Db7 - C The A7 and G7 are replaced with dominants a tritone away, creating a descending chromatic progression. Functioning Dominant Substitutions b3 Away A functioning dominant can be substituted by any other dominant that is located a multiple of a minor 3rd away. Barry Harris refers to this as “playing with your sisters and brothers”. Such substitutions yield interesting note choices, and are a different approach to alterations than using the Melodic Minor Scale. One of the substituting dominant chords (b5 away) is the tritone sub. Example 1: G7 Building a dom7 chord on the bb7 of G7 (3 multiples of b3 up) creates E7, which contains the notes E, Ab, B, D. These are 6, b9, 3, and 5 in reference to G7 - so substituting E7 creates a G7 chord with with 13 and b9 notes. In the following table, “Sub Chord” is the substitute chord (with the first row simply being the original chord), “Orig. Chord Degrees” are the degrees of the sub in relation to the original chord, and the last two columns show examples over G7. Table 2.3: Functioning Dominant Substitutions b3 Away Example in G Sub Chord Orig. Chord Degrees Sub Chord Notes dom7 on R R-3-5-b7 G7 G-B-D-F dom7 on b3 #9-5-b7-b9 Bb7 Bb-D-F-Ab dom7 on b5 b5-b7-b9-3 Db7 Db-F-Ab-B dom7 on bb7 6-b9-3-5 E7 E-Ab-B-D Examples in Progressions A7 - Dm7 - G7 - C -&gt; C7 - Dm7 - Bb7 - C A7 is replaced with C7 (built on bb7), and G7 is replaced with Bb7 (built on b3). Adding movement to a chord Some ideas to add movement to chords. Secondary dominants and ii chords Major and minor chords (not m7b5) can be preceded by a secondary dominant - a dominant chord that resolves a 4th up (or 5th down). The secondary dominants (besides the main V) are not in the original scale, but can be played before their resolution chords to add interest. For example, the V chord in C Major is G7 (the dominant of Cmaj7); Dm7’s secondary dominant is A7, Em7’s is B7, and so on. Taking this further, a functioning dominant can be preceeded by its ii chord. Generally, the ii chord is minor 7 when resolving to major or maj7, and m7b5 when resolving to a minor, m7 or m6.
