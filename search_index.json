"],["diatonic-chords-in-common-scales.html", "Chapter 1 Diatonic Chords in Common Scales References", " Chapter 1 Diatonic Chords in Common Scales This section lists triads and chords in the Major, and Minor scales. Chords in these scales are constructed using intervals of 3rds. E.g., in the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the C major 7 chord is constructed using C, E, G, B.

The substitutions shown here are built from degrees of the original chord, and are in the same scale. Such substitutions add extensions to a chord in order of the scale degrees. Example 1: subs over Cmaj7 using the C major scale: Cmaj7 has the notes C, E, G, B. The sub built on the 3rd (E) is Em7 (notes E, G, B, D). Playing Em7 over Cmaj7 adds a 9th to the original Cmaj7. Playing G7 (G B D F) over Cmaj7 adds the extensions 9 and 11, and playing Bm7b5 (B, C, F, A) adds the extensions 9, 11, and 13. Example 2: subs over Fmaj7 in the C major scale: Fmaj7 has the notes F, A, C, E. The sub built on the 3rd (A) is Am7 (notes A, C, E, G). Playing Am7 over Fmaj7 adds a 9th to the original Fmaj7. However, playing Cmaj7 (C E G B) over Fmaj7 adds the notes G (9th) and B (#11), not 9th and 11. This is because the C major scale has a natural B, not a Bb, so using it for building the substitute chord yields the #11 extension. In the following table, “Scale Chord” is the original chord, “Subs built on chord tones” contains the diatonic chords built on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th (or flat 7th) degrees of the original chords, and “Ext. added” contains all the extensions added (the sub on 7th degree provides all 3 extensions). The other set of columns provides an example in G major. Concretely, for the scale chord ii (Am7 in G major scale), the diatonic chord built on the 5th degree is the vi chord of the parent scale (Em7 in G major), and playing vi over ii yields extensions 9 and 11.
