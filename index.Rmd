# About {-}

A set of condensed notes on various music theory topics, focusing on jazz and guitar.

# Disclaimer: Music Theory vs Sounding Good {-}
Music theory is fun and can be used to try to understand why a particular chord progression or melody sounds the way it does, or how to approach soloing over a tune. But theory should not dictate what to play, or that something *should* sound good because the theory says so. It also seems that music theory doesn't always neatly describe everything that's going on, and explanations break down from time to time.
